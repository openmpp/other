## Please join our UI project discussion

OpenM++ UI is an advanced beta which incorporates significant portions of core required UI functionality, but which is missing others.  The underlying software architecture is modern and layered, to make it easy to change or evolve the UI. Lower layers of openM++ contain functionality (eg run import and export, result export, distributed cloud execution) which is not yet exposed or accessible in the current UI.

Your feedback on the openM++ UI is welcomed. Please feel free to join and participate in discussion of the openM++ UI at <https://github.com/orgs/openmpp/teams/openmpp-ui>. 

To join the discussion, create a GutHub account if you donâ€™t already have one.
